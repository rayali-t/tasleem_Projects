AED FINAL PROJECT PRPOSAL

Problem Statement
During the time of disaster, donations usually start flowing in the disaster area immediately. It is imperative that efforts are made to coordinate and tackle the problems faced and prevent any further difficulties. Thus, donations planning, coordination, and management is necessary to avoid any chaos and wastage of time and resources. In order to smoothly carry out the donation management with accountability bestowed upon the respective organizations we propose “Disaster Donation Management System” application. The application would primarily track the actual needs of goods and medicines in the affected area and all the good donated by the people around the world. It would record the shipment of these goods and the deployed volunteers for its distribution. The application would also track the inflow of cash donations.

Our application comprises of two enterprises and each of these enterprises cover various organizations under them:
1.	NGO Enterprise -
a.	Human Resource
b.	Relief Fund Organization
c.	Pharmacist Organization
2.	Logistics Enterprise – 
a.	Transport Organization
b.	Good Management

Some of the key functionalities of the application are listed below :
•	Requirement (Stock) gathering
Based on the requirement list, donors would be able to donate required goods for the nearest area by creating a request in the application. Donors can also donate certain amount towards relief. 

•	Registering for volunteering work
Volunteers can register for volunteering work in the affected area. They would be able to take on one of the responsibilities amongst the list of volunteering duties. 

•	Creating requests for medicines
For the affected victims, volunteers can put in requests for the medicines required for the victims. The pharmacist would then provide with the medicines.

•	Collecting the donations from the donors
Collector under the logistics enterprise would collect the donations by the donors and segeregated it based on the areas. Additionally, the amount collected would be distributed amongst the victims according to their needs, and the request to deduct utilized amount would be processed by the head coordinator.


•	Tracking the logistics transport
The items collected would be shipped to the respective areas. A request would be put in by the coordinator of the logistics for the same when a package is shipped and once received, the volunteer in charge of shipment would process the request with appropriate comments.
